<h1>Automation Practice</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is my first automation repository. It contains all the practice tests I've created so far.</p>
<p>I built this project from scratch based on the courses I've taken this past few months. My goal is to put myself out there, show what I'm able to do and keep improving my knowledge and automation skills.</p>
<p>I look forward to keep learning and developing new skills!</p>
